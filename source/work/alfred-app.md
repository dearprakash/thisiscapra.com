For this project, Ollie was approached by Andrew and Vero Pepperell, a talented developer and marketing team, to create the original design and branding for a quicklauncher that simplifies and speeds up your workflow.

Its launch went viral (thanks to web designers and other mac users who love all things beautiful) and has been successful ever since. Alfred App is your computer’s butler: it is a highly rated and popular productivity app for OSX that is being used by tens of thousands of Apple users worldwide.
