This May, Ollie and I participated in  [Aquahacking](http://aquahacking.com), an event to create apps for the Ottawa River.  Our team made an app called [River Ranger](http://riverranger.ca), which was designed to let the general public report problems they spotted, and also to see any data that the RiverKeepers had collected. 

####If you want to see more about the design of River Ranger, check out our [labs page](http://thisiscapra.com/labs/river-ranger).

We presented our app on May 30 at the first ever Water Summit, with a panel of amazing judges. We are pleased to have been awarded first place alongside one other team!  The judges really felt that a combination of our two apps would be the best solution.  Ours engaged the public, and the other team's app provided some admin tools for the associations to respond to issues.

All of the teams that presented had amazing ideas, and it was such an honour to have participated in this event.  Here's a great pic of all the presenters. My favourite was the drone automated service.

Ollie recorded my presentation.  It's not very high quality, but it's a great way to see what it's all about!
