[Naked](https://github.com/thisiscapra/shopify-naked) is a [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) theme stripped back to the bare essentials. It's based on the [Skeleton theme](https://github.com/Shopify/skeleton-theme) from Shopify but has all presentational markup, CSS and JS removed so it can be used as a blank starting point for theme development. 

I always found myself having to remove so much un-needed code from client sites it made sense to create a blank theme that could be publicly used. It is for more advanced Shopify developers and I'm not supporting it in any way as it's open source. I will try to keep updating it to keep it in line with Skeleton for liquid code updates.
