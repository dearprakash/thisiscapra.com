I have my local dev environment set up with Pow and I then make Apache listen on Port 81 for any PHP apps I'm doing on `.dev`. I'm currently working on a Wordpress Sub-domain multisite yet I was stumped as the sub-domain alias wasn't working for me locally using the following...

```
<Directory "/Users/olliekav/Sites/">
  AllowOverride All
  Require all granted
</Directory>

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:81>
  ServerName any.dev
  ServerAlias *.dev
  VirtualDocumentRoot "/Users/olliekav/Sites/%1"
</VirtualHost>
```

It turns out I needed to change the VirtualDocumentRoot to the following...

```
VirtualDocumentRoot "/Users/olliekav/Sites/%-2"
```

And Voil√†, the sub-domain is now working.

**%-2 in the VirtualDocumentRoot represents the penultimate dot-separated part of foo.com, i.e. foo. You could then have directories as you wish that map to the sites**
