As [Alfred App](http://www.alfredapp.com) turned 5 years old last week and I've been lucky to work on the design, branding & UI throughtout that I thought I would document how it has evolved.

###Alfred beta

When [Vero](https://twitter.com/vero) & [Andrew](https://twitter.com/preppeller) came to me in 2010 with an idea for a new quick launcher for OSX I jumped at the chance to create the original branding and website. They had a name, Alfred, but nothing else so we trashed around some ideas and using Batman/Alfred as a theme we settled on a butler hat with an old style magnifying glass for the app icon. I then procedded to sketch out some initial ideas and throw some shapes in illustrator. Having never worked on an app icon for OSX before I had to research best practices for formats and tools to create the icon, it also involed learning how to use the mesh tool in illustrator which can be rather daunting when you've never used it before. We worked through some iterations shown below before we settled on the Alfred beta icon.

The next thing we needed to work on was the website, it had to be simple (reflecting the app itself), impactful and beautiful. I went with a simple 2 color design with centered text and some small decoration items.

It went down quite well within the design community, even drawing the attention of a few 'web celebrities'.

###Alfred grows up - v1

The beta period was very well received by the Apple community and Andrew & Vero continued to refine the UI and add features based on the feedback from the beta lauch. The version numbers were growing rapidly and we were nearing the launch of v1, with this came a need to re-design the website and work on some of the interface iconography for the new features. We decided to keep the icon the same for now and just focus on a fresh look for the website plus the introduction of the Powerpack. I also worked with Andrew on some of the UI design for the Powerpack features. Andrew, who is also an excellent UI designer as well as a developer, already had most of the UI planned out so we just researched some ideas together for various apsects of the interface. A lot of this work was simplified down or shelved in the end but it's interesting to see some of the work in progress.

We also added a few variations on the Alfred icon for other features or marketing campaigns.

###Alfred V2

Alfred V2 gave us the chance to not only refine and iterate on a lot of work we had done before, but also give a fresh lick of paint to the App icon and iconography. For the Alfred icon I played around with new textures for the hat and better lighting, but the magnifying glass was the main focus to make it look more realistic. I experimented with thin and thin bezels, leather textures, new lighting sources for the metal frame and even gold!

In the end we settled on a thinner bezel keeping the silver frame and a new leather texture on the handle, with better lighting and shadow effects for the glass and frame.

The iconography needed updating for the new retina screens. Lucklily I had done all the originals as vectors so it was just a case of updating the sizes and tweaking some of the paths to make sure all the pixels looked sharp and crisp, a few were redrawn again to make them more realistic.

For the website, Andrew & Vero didn't want to completely overhaul the look and feel we had defined with V1, it was more a case of giving it a fresh look and bringing it upto date. We stripped it back to be a bit more minimal and refined with small hints of the Alfred wallpaper and other decorative elements. It was also built responsively to work across all devices.

This has been a big year for Alfred, it has turned 5 and also celebrated the release of [Remote](https://www.alfredapp.com/remote). They are currently offering 15% discount off the Powerpack so make sure you grab a deal.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Wowsers, Alfred is 5 years oldâ€¦ how about a cheeky 15% Powerpack discount? <a href="http://t.co/t0MqMnJ6nq">http://t.co/t0MqMnJ6nq</a> :)</p>&mdash; Alfred App (@alfredapp) <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredapp/status/571354850065289216">February 27, 2015</a></blockquote>

So there you have it, an overview of how the Alfred brand and design has evolved over the last 5 years. Who knows what will happen with v3?
