    testimonial: "I've worked with Kat and Ollie on numberous projects over the years for many different companies and they are always the first people I turn to when I need a high quality product to be delivered. 850 Sports Digest was the most intense project we have worked on together yet with me setting tight budgets and pushing on delivery times and asking the world of the quality of the look and feel and features. But as always, they delivered above expectation and even advised me when they thought my thinking was on the wrong track. With their long, flawless track record in design, UI /UX and even front-end development, this kind of two way relationship is very valuable and my app is a much better product because of it."

The new site is built on a customised wordpress install with extended scalability."

    intro: "MindtheProduct is a very popular meetup group for product managers, and in 2012 they launched their very first conference in London, UK.

The <a href='http://mtpcon.com/london/2012' alt='Mind the Product Conference 2012'>first year&#8217;s website</a> was a simple one-page design, based on their brand&#8217;s colours and logo, where the circles moved as you scrolled."
    sub_text: "Because we were both so pleased with the first year&#8217;s efforts, we knew we had to come up with something fun and different for the second year. So, <a href='http://mtpcon.com/london/2013' alt='Mind The Product Conference 2013'>2013</a> website features a video background from last year&#8217;s conference. This website was designed to inspire product managers to make great, innovative products.  <br /><br />Then in <a href='http://mtpcon.com/london/2014' alt='Mind The Product Conference 2014'>2014</a>, the founders decided to go for simple and practical yet elegant.  We created a website that could be modified through Wordpress, and could be reused for future years. The build needed to be flexible for <a href='http://mtpcon.com'>2015</a> to adapt to multiple locations (San Francisco and London this year!), pre-conference (no speakers, just teasers), full conference (speakers, tickets for sale) and post conference (wrap up, thank you and archiving).
