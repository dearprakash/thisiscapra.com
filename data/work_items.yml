We were responsible for everything visual, from the logo to how to simplify concepts using visuals (colour, layout and a common visual language), as well as preparing assets for print. We also had fun making the supporting website! It was launched in December 2015, and is now available for purchase or to use as an open-source game (print and play). </p> <p></p>"

    intro: "<p>Mind the Product is a very popular meetup group for product managers. In 2012 they launched their very first conference in London, UK, and founder Martin Erikkson approached Kat to come up with a simple, elegant design.</p> <p>The <a href=http://mtpcon.com/london/2012 alt=Mind the Product Conference 2012>first year&#8217;s website</a> was a straightforward one-page design, based on their brand&#8217;s colours and logo, where the circles moved as you scrolled.</p>"
    sub_text: "Since we were both so pleased with the first year&#8217;s website, we knew we had to come up with something fun and different for the second year. So the <a href=http://mtpcon.com/london/2013 alt=Mind The Product Conference 2013>2013</a> website features a video background from the previous year&#8217;s conference. This website was designed to inspire product managers to make great, innovative products.  <br /><br />Then in <a href=http://mtpcon.com/london/2014 alt=Mind The Product Conference 2014>2014</a>, the founders decided to go for simple, practical and elegant.  We created a website that could be modified through Wordpress and could be reused in future years. The build needed to be flexible for <a href=http://mtpcon.com>the 2015 version</a> to adapt to multiple locations (San Francisco and London this year!), pre-conference (no speakers, just teasers), full conference (speakers, tickets for sale) and post conference (wrap up, thank you and archiving).  We continue to work with Martin and the rest of the Mind The Product team to keep their website fresh!"
