This website was designed to inspire product managers to make great, innovative products.  <br /><br />Then in <a href=http://mtpcon.com/london/2014 alt=Mind The Product Conference 2014>2014</a>, the founders decided to go for simple, practical and elegant.  We created a website that could be modified through Wordpress and could be reused in future years. The build needed to be flexible for <a href=http://mtpcon.com>the 2015 version</a> to adapt to multiple locations (San Francisco and London this year!), pre-conference (no speakers, just teasers), full conference (speakers, tickets for sale) and post conference (wrap up, thank you and archiving).
