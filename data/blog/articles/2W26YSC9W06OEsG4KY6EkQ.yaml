  questions #earlyandoften -tnx for the reminder @kassy4 #CanUX\n\n<cite>[@tinaliseng](https://twitter.com/tinaliseng/status/663399589194633216)</cite>\n\n![intro-screen](//images.contentful.com/l7v8i27hlera/d47k6RBux2AAO6QusmwW8/00509b6fbafec12c727ca5d9c8f6f4f7/intro-screen.jpg)\n\nI
  spoke at [CanUX](http://canuxconf.org/)this past weekend. I got to teach people
  about the power of prototyping to solve difficult problems, and promote teamwork.
  And, I got to present a bit on how games in prototyping can help us be more open-minded,
  creative and productive. I went hands-on to show them that first ideas are often
  very common, and everyone loved it!\n\n> Just reinvented bingo for 3 with my friendly
  Vancouver colleague. And we did the same as nearly all the audience! @kassy4 #canux\n\n<cite>[@arbastien](https://twitter.com/arbastien/status/663388849259737088)</cite>\n\n\nThank
  you to all those organizing CanUX. What a class act. Can't wait to do more speaking!\n\n\nHere's
  a link to the [pdf of my slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zi9fqw1dd4dvmfd/prototyping-nouveau.pdf?dl=0)
