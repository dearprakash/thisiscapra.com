  ### A new way for women to crowdfund

  Capra was lucky to be involved in the launch of [f-crowd](http://f-crowd.com), a UK venture to encourage women entrepreneurs, and it's been founded by [3 talented sisters](https://f-crowd.com/about/team/). More than just a crowd-funding platform, f-crowd really works to link women up with mentors and help formulate beautiful, successful campaigns. Women are naturally entrepreneurial, but don't seem to be getting the funding that would help them grow as easily as they should. They have gathered some really interesting facts on how factors such as how many children you have had, funding received, and getting mentor support can all impact women's businesses.

  We worked extensively with the founders to make sure that they could release a website they were proud of.  We're proud of it too!

  They are just beginning this exciting venture with two talented entrepreneurs:  [Emily London](https://f-crowd.com/projects/hat-blocks/) is fundraising to purchase hat blocks for her hat making company, and [Maham Anjum](https://f-crowd.com/projects/a-new-kiln/) is fundraising to purchase her own kiln for her pottery business.
