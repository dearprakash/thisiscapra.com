  alt=\"Proof in the prototype titlepage\"></figure>\n\nLast night I was lucky enough
  to present at [Refresh Ottawa](http://www.meetup.com/Refresh-Ottawa/) and was blown
  away by how people engaged with the concepts I was presenting. \n\nPrototyping is
  really fun, and I hope I've inspired a few people to open up their minds and work
  processes to it.  \n\nSince the world is inherently distorted by mental prototypes,
  we battled against our 'first ideas', while sometimes finding out that it is our
  preconceived ideas that are stopping us from being really innovative.\n\nBy prototyping,
  we can get people to 'see' what we mean, and discover the real problems with what
  we're doing before it's too late to make changes. \n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4461726/thisiscapra/prototyping/the-real-problem.jpg\"
  alt=\"The real problem\"></figure>\n\nAnd by searching out the real problem, I hope
  I've shown them that finding out, through rapid prototyping that something just
  doesn't work, is actually a really big win, not a fail.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4461726/thisiscapra/prototyping/arts-crafts.jpg\"

  a new game. Thank you so much to everyone at Refresh Ottawa for letting me share
  my ideas, and for Shopify for hosting!\n\n###The slides\n\nFor those who asked,
