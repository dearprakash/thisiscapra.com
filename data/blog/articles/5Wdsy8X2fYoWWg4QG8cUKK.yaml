:body: "[Naked](https://github.com/thisiscapra/shopify-naked) is a [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/)
  theme stripped back to the bare essentials. It's based on the [Skeleton theme](https://github.com/Shopify/skeleton-theme)
  from Shopify but has all presentational markup, CSS and JS removed so it can be
  used as a blank starting point for theme development. \n\nI always found myself
  having to remove so much un-needed code from client sites it made sense to create
  a blank theme that could be publicly used. It is for more advanced Shopify developers
  and I'm not supporting it in any way as it's open source. I will try to keep updating
  it to keep it in line with Skeleton for liquid code updates.\n\n[It's available
  on Github](https://github.com/thisiscapra/shopify-naked)"
