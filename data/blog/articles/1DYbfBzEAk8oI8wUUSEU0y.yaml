  We are no longer working on River Ranger. It is now called [Water Rangers](http://waterrangers.ca).\n\nThis
  May, Ollie and I participated in  [Aquahacking](http://aquahacking.com), an event
  to create apps for the Ottawa River.  Our team made an app called [River Ranger](http://riverranger.ca),
  which was designed to let the general public report problems they spotted, and also
  to see any data that the RiverKeepers had collected. \n\n#####If you want to see
  more about the design of River Ranger, check out our [labs page](http://thisiscapra.com/labs/river-ranger).\n\n<figure><img

  alt=\"Kat and teammate Mark presenting riverranger\"></figure>\n\nWe presented our
  app on May 30 at the first ever Water Summit, with a panel of amazing judges. We
  are pleased to have been awarded first place alongside one other team!  The judges
  really felt that a combination of our two apps would be the best solution.  Ours
  engaged the public, and the other team's app provided some admin tools for the associations
  to respond to issues.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4461726/thisiscapra/winners.jpg\"

  had amazing ideas, and it was such an honour to have participated in this event.
  \ Here's a great pic of all the presenters. My favourite was the drone automated
  service.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4461726/thisiscapra/aqua-hackers.jpg\"

  not very high quality, but it's a great way to see what it's all about!\n\n<div
