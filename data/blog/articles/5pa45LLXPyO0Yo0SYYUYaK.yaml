:body: "One of the best parts about being in Canada, is the fun we have in Winter!
  Here at Capra, qe are so lucky to have flexible work schedules, and that means getting
  outside in the daytime. This morning, it was a brisk -15, with a windchill of -25.
  But, the crispness meant that the sunrise was glorious, and plants with frost on
  them twinkled like millions of diamonds.\n\n![winter](//images.contentful.com/l7v8i27hlera/5TFnh0V1kskWCSIG4oA4U2/014c27cba3b4983e7a6749ce25d66a63/winter.jpg)\n\nGetting
  outside is the best way to get through the long winters here. A few of the things
  we've been doing:\n\n1. Snowboarding: We can start work super early and spend our
  afternoons on the slopes. We're trying to go once a week.\n2. Snowshoeing: My personal
  favourite! Don't let that deep snow get you down. It's a great workout too.\n3.
  Cross-country skiing: Not done much of this yet this year, but now that the lake
  is frozen, I can get going! My skis are back-country so I can create my own trails.
  Although there's loads of groomed trails in the Ottawa area, I like to go with my
  dogs!\n4. Hiking: When the snow's packed down, it's just as good to get out.\n\nI'm
  not a big fan of skating (my sensitive feet hate the pressure/tightness), but I
  think I've got enough to do! \n\n![snowshoes](//images.contentful.com/l7v8i27hlera/K9BaupoVeEmcsqE4YcAAi/0181e65f268ba656e69d7057e7848d5b/snowshoes.jpg)
