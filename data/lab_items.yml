    intro: "Hip-Hop Quoted started out as a labour of love in 2008 to combine two of my loves in life, Hip-Hop and Typography/Design and explore some of the web's capabilities to do some interesting layouts. It was originally built in Wordpress but over time became quite difficult to manage and scale to my needs."
    sub_text: "Fast forward to 2014 and I've slowly been rebuilding the site over the past year to take advantage of new web technologies, HTML5, CSS3, webfonts and advanced layout tools. SVG's are used for images and it is now full responsive to work across a multitude of devices and screen sizes."

  - name: Dragimals
    weight: 2
    intro: "Dragimals is a fun 'sticky' game, where small children can create scenes with delightful animating animals!. Dragimals is a true labour of love, built by developer Elliott Draper of KickCode with designer Kat Neville."
    sub_text: "Elliott loved teaching his young children to use the iPad but found that there was a lack of simple, fun and easy to play apps for babies and toddlers that focused less on game progression, and more on teaching gestures and interactions. Luckily, he loved to build things."
