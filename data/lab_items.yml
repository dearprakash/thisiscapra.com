    intro: "Hip-Hop Quoted started out as a labour of love in 2008 to combine two of Ollie&#8217;s loves in life: Hip-Hop and Typography. He also used it as a medium to explore some of the web&#8217;s capabilities to design and build interesting layouts. "
    sub_text: "It was originally built in Wordpress but over time became quite difficult to manage and scale. So, in 2014 he rebuilt the site to take advantage of new web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, webfonts and advanced layout tools. He uses SVGs for images and it is now fully responsive to work across a multitude of devices and screen sizes."

    intro: "Dragimals is a fun &#8216;sticky&#8217; game, where small children can create scenes with delightful animating animals! Dragimals is designed by Kat, and built by developer <a href='http://kickcode.com' alt='KickCode'>Elliott Draper</a>."
    sub_text: "After finding that there was a lack of simple, fun and easy to play apps for babies and toddlers, the design was designed to focused less on game progression, and more on teaching gestures and interactions. Learning about usability for babies was very interesting because they lacked to mobile dexterity and symbol recognition that older kids have."
